    <h1>Become a Productivity Ninja with These Windows Shortcuts</h1>
    <p>
      The mouse may be a wonderful invention and even unrivaled when it comes to
      shooting off heads in Counter Strike, but in all its pointy glory, it is
      no match for the blazing speed and precision that the keyboard affords you
      in almost everything else you need getting done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Especially, if most of your work is done on a laptop with a touchpad—
      learning keyboard shortcuts is a must. For everything you can do with a
      mouse, there is a better and faster keyboard alternative. So why do you
      need two ways to perform the same function? Why does the mouse even exist?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, learning keyboard shortcuts take time and a lot of practice, so the
      mouse exists to make the learning curve much easier. But once you have
      mastered keyboard magic, using a mouse or a trackpad will seem excessive,
      wasteful and slower to you, a considerable waste of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, once you have selected some text, copying something using
      CTRL+C takes less than a second. Alternatively, the same task takes two
      clicks (and some movement) to accomplish using a mouse and is slower.

      So without further delay, lets start learning some pretty handy keyboard
      shortcuts. For this guide, Ive focused primarily on Microsoft Windows OS,
      which is the most dominant operating system in use today.
